Similarly, physics-informed inductive biases in deep-learning frameworks have been shown to give superior performance in learning the dynamics of physical systems. There is a growing volume of literature that attempts to combine these two approaches. Here, we evaluate the performance of thirteen different graph neural networks, namely, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian graph neural networks, graph neural ODE, and their variants with explicit constraints and different architectures. We briefly explain the theoretical formulation highlighting the similarities and differences in the inductive biases and graph architecture of these systems. Then, we evaluate them on spring, pendulum, and gravitational and 3D deformable solid systems to compare the performance in terms of rollout error, conserved quantities such as energy and momentum, and generalizability to unseen system sizes. Our study demonstrates that GNNs with additional inductive biases, such as explicit constraints and decoupling of kinetic and potential energies, exhibit significantly enhanced performance. Further, all the physics-informed GNNs exhibit zero-shot generalizability to system sizes an order of magnitude larger than the training system, thus providing a promising route to simulate large-scale realistic systems.","2022-09-17","2023-05-19 17:57:04","2023-05-19 17:57:04","2023-05-19 17:57:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","openreview.net","","","","/Users/ravinder/Zotero/storage/S3P52CKL/Thangamuthu et al. - 2022 - Unravelling the Performance of Physics-informed Gr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Thirty-sixth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present a Lagrangian graph neural network (LGNN) that can learn the dynamics of articulated rigid bodies by exploiting their topology. We demonstrate the performance of LGNN by learning the dynamics of ropes, chains, and trusses with the bars modeled as rigid bodies. LGNN also exhibits generalizability---LGNN trained on chains with a few segments exhibits generalizability to simulate a chain with large number of links and arbitrary link length. We also show that the LGNN can simulate unseen hybrid systems including bars and chains, on which they have not been trained on. Specifically, we show that the LGNN can be used to model the dynamics of complex real-world structures such as the stability of tensegrity structures.

Alternatively, Neural ODEs with appropriate inductive biases have also been shown to give similar performances. However, these models, when applied to particle-based systems, are transductive in nature and hence, do not generalize to large system sizes. In this paper, we present a graph-based neural ODE, GNODE, to learn the time evolution of dynamical systems. Further, we carefully analyze the role of different inductive biases on the performance of GNODE. We show that similar to LNN and HNN, encoding the constraints explicitly can significantly improve the training efficiency and performance of GNODE significantly. Our experiments also assess the value of additional inductive biases, such as Newton’s third law, on the final performance of the model. We demonstrate that inducing these biases can enhance the performance of the model by orders of magnitude in terms of both energy violation and rollout error. Interestingly, we observe that the GNODE trained with the most effective inductive biases, namely MCGNODE, outperforms the graph versions of LNN and HNN, namely, Lagrangian graph networks (LGN) and Hamiltonian graph networks (HGN) in terms of energy violation error by ∼4 orders of magnitude for a pendulum system, and ∼2 orders of magnitude for spring systems. These results suggest that NODE-based systems can give competitive performances with energy-conserving neural networks by employing appropriate inductive biases.","2023-02-01","2023-05-19 17:57:12","2023-05-19 17:57:12","2023-05-19 17:57:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","openreview.net","","","","/Users/ravinder/Zotero/storage/SVEG4P9G/Bishnoi et al. - 2023 - Enhancing the Inductive Biases of Graph Neural ODE.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these models still suffer from issues such as inability to generalize to arbitrary system sizes, poor interpretability, and most importantly, inability to learn translational and rotational symmetries, which lead to the conservation laws of linear and angular momentum, respectively. Here, we present a momentum conserving Lagrangian neural network (MCLNN) that learns the Lagrangian of a system, while also preserving the translational and rotational symmetries.

Similar to archetypical glasses, it is observed that the glassy structures are disordered, marked by the absence of any long-range order while exhibiting some short-range order. Further, the structures obtained are stable in three dimensions, confirming the realistic nature of the 2D glasses. Interestingly, it is observed that the orientational order of the h-BN structure with respect to density as well as ground state enthalpy follows a master curve for both crystallization and glass transition, revealing thermally accessible regions for the structure. Further, the standard deviation of orientational order provides information about the spatial heterogeneity in the structure, the rearrangement of which results in the formation of crystal/glass. This suggests that the orientational order may play a crucial role in controlling the propensity for crystallization/glass transition in systems having directional bonds.","2020","2023-05-19 17:57:25","2023-05-19 17:57:25","2023-05-19 17:57:24","1900174","","2","3","","","Glass Transition and Crystallization in Hexagonal Boron Nitride","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/adts.201900174","","/Users/ravinder/Zotero/storage/M4BGECMX/Ravinder et al. - 2020 - Glass Transition and Crystallization in Hexagonal .pdf","","","2D glasses; boron nitride; glass transition; orientational order","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, using peridynamics simulations, we investigate the role of the mechanical properties and geometry in determining the overall damage on a glass plate subjected to ballistic impact. In particular, we analyze the role of bullet velocity, bullet material, and elastic modulus, fracture energy, and radius of the plate. Interestingly, we observe a power-law dependence between the total damage and the fracture energy of the glass plate. Through an auto-regressive analysis of the evolution of cracks, we demonstrate that the self-affine growth of cracks leads to this power-law dependence. Overall, the present study illustrates how peridynamic simulations can offer new insights into the fracture mechanics of glasses subjected to ballistic impacts.

We show that the nanoscale plasticity observed in the irradiated structure is reminiscent of metal-like plasticity, which is neither observed in the isochemical crystalline or glassy structure. Invoking an energy landscape approach, we demonstrate that the local atomic self-organization facilitated by the shallow energy landscape is at the origin of this plastic behavior. Overall, the results suggest that the irradiation could be a methodology to induce a ductile transition in materials that are otherwise brittle.","2020","2023-05-19 17:58:36","2023-05-19 17:58:36","2023-05-19 17:58:36","3962-3970","","7","103","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jace.16951","","/Users/ravinder/Zotero/storage/UUZZ7285/Ravinder et al. - 2020 - Irradiation-induced brittle-to-ductile transition .pdf","","","ductility; fracture; glass; molecular dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, accelerated design of glasses for targeted applications remain impeded due to the lack of composition–property models. To this extent, exploiting a large dataset of glasses comprising of up to 37 oxide components and more than 100 000 glass compositions, we develop high-fidelity deep neural networks for the prediction of eight properties that enable the design of glasses, namely, density, Young's modulus, shear modulus, hardness, glass transition temperature, thermal expansion coefficient, liquidus temperature, and refractive index. We demonstrate that the models developed here exhibit excellent predictability, ensuring its ability to capture the underlying nonlinear composition–property relationships. Using these models, we develop a series of new design charts, termed as glass selection charts. These charts enable the rational design of functional glasses for targeted applications by identifying unique compositions that satisfy two or more constraints, on both compositions and properties, simultaneously.","2020-07-06","2023-05-19 17:58:39","2023-05-19 17:58:39","2023-05-19 17:58:39","1819-1827","","7","7","","Mater.

The GPR's main advantage over other machine learning methods is its inherent ability to provide the standard deviation of the predictions. However, the method remains restricted to small datasets due to the substantial computational cost associated with it. Herein, using a scalable GPR algorithm, namely, kernel interpolation for scalable structured Gaussian processes (KISS-GP) along with massively scalable GP (MSGP), we develop composition–property models for inorganic glasses. The models are based on a large dataset with more than 100 000 glass compositions, 37 components, and nine crucial properties: density, Young's, shear, bulk moduli, thermal expansion coefficient, Vickers’ hardness, refractive index, glass transition temperature, and liquidus temperature. We show that the models developed here are superior to the state-of-the-art machine learning models. We also demonstrate that the GPR models can reasonably capture the underlying composition-dependent physics, even in the regions where there are very few training data.

Despite several years of research and analysis, some fundamental and practical questions on glasses still remain unanswered. While most of the earlier approaches were based on (i) expert knowledge and intuition, (ii) Edisonian trial and error, or (iii) physics-driven modeling and analysis, recent studies suggest that data-driven techniques, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), can provide fresh perspectives to tackle some of these questions. In this article, we identify 21 grand challenges in glass science, the solutions of which are either enabling AI and ML or enabled by AI and ML to accelerate the field of glass science. The challenges presented here range from fundamental questions related to glass formation and composition–processing–property relationships to industrial problems such as automated flaw detection in glass manufacturing. We believe that the present article will instill enthusiasm among the readers to explore some of the grand challenges outlined here and to discover many more challenges that can advance the field of glass science, engineering, and technology.","2021","2023-05-19 17:58:46","2023-05-19 17:58:46","2023-05-19 17:58:46","277-292","","3","12","","","Artificial intelligence and machine learning in glass science and technology","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ijag.15881","","/Users/ravinder/Zotero/storage/KSAAKF5F/Ravinder et al. - 2021 - Artificial intelligence and machine learning in gl.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Developing compositions with tailored Abbe number (Vd) and refractive index at 587.6 nm (nd), two crucial optical properties, is a major challenge. To this extent, machine learning (ML) approaches have been successfully used to develop composition–property models. However, these models are essentially black boxes in nature and suffer from the lack of interpretability. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of ML models to predict the composition-dependent variations of Vd and nd. Further, using Shapely additive explanations (SHAP), we interpret the ML models to identify the contribution of each of the input components toward target prediction. We observe that glass formers such as SiO2, B2O3, and P2O5 and intermediates such as TiO2, PbO, and Bi2O3 play a significant role in controlling the optical properties. Interestingly, components contributing toward increasing the nd are found to decrease the Vd and vice versa. Finally, we develop the Abbe diagram, using the ML models, allowing accelerated discovery of new glasses for optical properties beyond the experimental pareto front. Overall, employing explainable ML, we predict and interpret the compositional control on the optical properties of oxide glasses.","2022","2023-05-19 17:58:50","2023-05-19 17:58:50","2023-05-19 17:58:50","4046-4057","","6","105","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jace.18345","","/Users/ravinder/Zotero/storage/EHVNRWN8/Zaki et al. - 2022 - Interpreting the optical properties of oxide glass.pdf","","","glass; lead-free glass; optical materials/properties; refractive index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, we use a dataset consisting of ∼275,000 glass compositions comprising of 221 different components and 25 properties. This is by far the largest model developed in the literature. The analysis reveals that the glass components, such as network formers, modifiers, and intermediates, play distinct roles in governing the optical, physical, electrical, and mechanical properties of glasses. Interestingly, these components exhibit interdependence, the magnitude of which is different for different properties. While the physical origins of some of these interdependencies could be explained using known phenomena, the majority of the remaining ones remain to be explored.

However, traditional approaches require the knowledge of several abstract quantities such as the energy or force to infer the dynamics of these particles. Here, we present a framework, namely, Lagrangian graph neural network (LGnn), that provides a strong inductive bias to learn the Lagrangian of a particle-based system directly from the trajectory. We test our approach on challenging systems with constraints and drag—LGnn outperforms baselines such as feed-forward Lagrangian neural network (Lnn) with improved performance. We also show the zero-shot generalizability of the system by simulating systems two orders of magnitude larger than the trained one and also hybrid systems that are unseen by the model, a unique feature. The graph architecture of LGnn significantly simplifies the learning in comparison to Lnn with ∼25 times better performance on ∼20 times smaller amounts of data. Finally, we show the interpretability of LGnn, which directly provides physical insights on drag and constraint forces learned by the model. LGnn can thus provide a fillip toward understanding the dynamics of physical systems purely from observable quantities.","2023-01","2023-05-19 17:59:00","2023-05-19 17:59:00","2023-05-19 17:59:00","015003","","1","4","","Mach.
