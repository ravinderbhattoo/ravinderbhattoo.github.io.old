abstract_note: "Liquids exhibit a sudden increase in viscosity when cooled fast enough, avoiding thermodynamically predicted route of crystallization. This phenomenon, known as glass transition, leads to the formation of non-periodic structures known as glasses. Extensive studies have been conducted on model materials to understand glass transition in two dimensions. However, despite the synthesis of disordered/amorphous single-atom thick structures of carbon, little attention has been given to glass transition in realistic two-dimensional materials such as graphene. Herein, using molecular dynamics simulation, we demonstrate the existence of glass transition in graphene leading to a realistic two-dimensional glassy structure, namely glassy graphene. We show that the resulting glassy structure exhibits excellent agreement with experimentally realized disordered graphene. Interestingly, this glassy graphene exhibits a wrinkled but stable structure, with reduced thermal vibration in comparison to its crystalline counterpart. We suggest that the topological disorder induced by glass transition governs the unique properties of this structure."
