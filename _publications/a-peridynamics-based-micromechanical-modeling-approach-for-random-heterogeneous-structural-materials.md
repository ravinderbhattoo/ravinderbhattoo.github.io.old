abstract_note: "This paper presents a peridynamics-based micromechanical analysis framework that can efficiently handle material failure for random heterogeneous structural materials. In contrast to conventional continuum-based approaches, this method can handle discontinuities such as fracture without requiring supplemental mathematical relations. The framework presented here generates representative unit cells based on microstructural information on the material and assigns distinct material behavior to the constituent phases in the random heterogenous microstructures. The framework incorporates spontaneous failure initiation/propagation based on the critical stretch criterion in peridynamics and predicts effective constitutive response of the material. The current framework is applied to a metallic particulate-reinforced cementitious composite. The simulated mechanical responses show excellent match with experimental observations signifying efficacy of the peridynamics-based micromechanical framework for heterogenous composites. Thus, the multiscale peridynamics-based framework can efficiently facilitate microstructure guided material design for a large class of inclusion-modified random heterogenous materials."
