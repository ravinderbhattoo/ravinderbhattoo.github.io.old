## Physics informed ML in civil engineering


## About me

He is a research associate in the Department of [Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/civil-environmental-engineering/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). His focus is on researching machine learning-aided structural design, multiscale material modeling, physics-informed machine learning, graph neural networks, dynamic fracture and crack propagation on ballistic impact, molecular dynamics, and peridynamics.

Previously, he worked as a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Civil Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in) from January 2023 to March 2023. He earned his Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi in January 2023, and his B.Tech. in Civil Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in) in June 2015. His Ph.D. research focused specifically on data-driven modeling and physics-informed machine learning for glass discovery.
